<p>I’ve worked across different environments in Chile and Canada, combining technology, operations, and service roles. My experience ranges from IT support and system reliability to hands-on customer service in fast-paced hospitality settings.</p>

This role has strengthened my communication skills, cultural awareness, and adaptability.</p>
<p>Previously, I’ve worked in structured corporate environments as well as operational and service-driven contexts, helping teams stay organized, efficient, and calm under pressure.</p>
